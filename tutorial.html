                    <h5>Abstract :</h5>
                    <p>Verification, testing and validation have all become challenging as the end applications of semiconductors have changed. The electronic systems have also become more complex. Automotive electronics, industrial systems and the Internet of Things have grown into huge markets today. Functional safety is most important in automotive electronics and industrial systems.  As a result, there are elevated expectations of the quality and reliability of the components used in these systems.  To make things worse, the security of these systems is under threat. To steal sensitive information, malicious attacks on electronic systems are planned. The following causes control systems to malfunction. </p>
                    <p>In this tutorial, we will look at the role of verification validation and testing of semiconductors in the modern setting.  The tutorial is for students and young professionals who are new to the area of semiconductor test.  The tutorial will expose the audience to some research problems. At the end of the tutorial, the audience will have an appreciation for new directions in the area of VLSI test and verification.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h5>Abstract :</h5>
                    <p>The talk will begin with the introduction and history of Natural Language Processing (NLP) as well as Computational Linguistics covering Symbolic, Statistical and Neural Network usage along with the use of deep learning for NLP. After the Turing Test, the audience will come to know about different types of languages like extinct languages, dead languages, isolated languages, proto-languages, sign languages, etc. Next, the focus on Indian low resource languages, the politics of languages, as well as the philosophy of languages and the concept of word order along with the language families will be discussed. The next topic will be a detailed discussion on pre-processing steps in NLP. NLP stages include phonetics, syntax, semantics, pragmatics and discourse will be discussed along with their respective sub-areas and applications like Tokenization, Terminology Extraction, Topic Segmentation, Named Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, etc. The phraseology of NLP will cover translation, transliteration, language, speech, dialect, script, character, alphabet, diacritics, words, types, tokens and terms. Discussion on interesting language projects on Punjabi, Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Sanskrit Seraiki, Burmese and English languages along with Pali, Prakrit, Kutchi, German, Spanish, Swahili, Nepali and Bengali will take place. The discussion will conclude with a glimpse of open research areas as well as challenges in the area of NLP.</p>
